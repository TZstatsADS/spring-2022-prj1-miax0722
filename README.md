## Project 1: A "data story" on the history of philosophy

### [Project Description](doc/)
+ Project title: An R data story figuring the difference between Capitalism and Communism by text mining

+ This project is conducted by [Sharon Meng]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] We know two philosophy schools --- Capitalism and Communism, are contradictory in the common sense. In this project, we want to figure out the contradictory point based on text mining. First we focus on the sentimental analysis and use the word-based and sentence-based analysis. We may not find it different when we analyze the sentiment on words, but when we focus a whole sentence, we may see anger be expressed from communism more as they may generate class war and so do their spirit. Also, it's clear that capitalism express more about money and price as they need to convince people to willingly put majority of power and wealth in the minority to keep the society stable. Then, if we see from the word cloud, we can see the most frequent words from different schools also explains their property respectively, and those words are extremely different. Therefore, the common sense can be proved by our data mining method in a way.
